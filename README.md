This group project was the final project for the CENG 476 (Big Data) course. In this project, we aimed to examine the relationship between fishing activities in the Black Sea and the natural conditions of the sea. We collected our data using APIs and made modifications using Kafka. Then, we stored it in MongoDB. After that, we analyzed our data in MongoDB using Spark to make predictions and wrote these results back to MongoDB.
